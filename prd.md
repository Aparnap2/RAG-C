# Enhanced MCP‑First, Type‑C RAG Platform: Advanced RAG Integration

Note: This framework is API‑agnostic by design with Google Cloud Advanced RAG techniques. All external connectivity (data sources, LLM calls, operational tools) occurs exclusively through MCP servers discovered and invoked at runtime over JSON‑RPC 2.0 via stdio or HTTP+SSE. Advanced techniques include multi-chunk strategies, hypothetical question generation, cross-encoder reranking, and multi-LLM orchestration—all mediated through MCP with zero vendor lock-in.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

## 1) Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1.1 Enhanced Vision
Deliver a cloud‑agnostic, MCP‑first RAG platform incorporating Google Cloud's advanced RAG techniques: multi-chunk strategies, hypothetical question generation, hybrid retrieval with RRF, cross-encoder reranking, and multi-LLM orchestration—all mediated through MCP servers with zero vendor lock-in. Context quality is paramount through advanced pre-processing, metadata enrichment, and multi-storage strategies.[2][4][1]

### 1.2 Goals and KPIs
- Accuracy: ≥80% precision@5; ≥70% recall@20 on golden sets; reranker lift ≥15% vs vector‑only baseline.[7][8][9]
- Latency: p95 ≤3s end‑to‑end with streaming tokens; p50 ≤1.8s.[4][10][11]
- Freshness: <5min ingestion→availability for sources supporting MCP streaming or incremental cursors.[12][1]
- Reliability: 99.9% query path availability; DLQ coverage and replay for all ingestion workers.[1][12]
- Portability: add/remove a source by registering/unregistering an MCP server; swap vector/text/graph stores via config only.[3][1]
- Security: 100% ACL enforcement in tests; auditable MCP call logs and permission scopes.[13][12]

### 1.3 Scope
- Phase 1: MCP host/registry, queue‑first ingestion, dual sinks (graph+text), hybrid retrieval (RRF) + cross‑encoder rerank, grounded generation, K8s/Helm deploy.[10][4][1]

- Phase 3: Autoscaling, cost‑aware model routing, canary+rollback, hardened MCP adapters for enterprise data (e.g., CRM/Dataverse) and memory tools.[12][13]

### 1.4 Assumptions
